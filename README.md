# Getting Started with Create React App

Welcome to BrainFlix Project. <br />

PHASE 1 <br />

The task involves building a prototype for a video streaming platform named BrainFlix within a three-week timeframe for funding meetings with venture capitalists. The project includes creating a responsive and functional app prototype based on provided designs. Key functional requirements include dynamic rendering of components, clickable sidebar videos that update the main video section, and adherence to React concepts. Visual design should closely resemble mockups, and implementation should follow specific folder structures and naming conventions. The site must utilize provided assets, consist of multiple React components, employ the <video> tag for the video player (without functionality), and use state to manage data from provided assets. Styling should be done using SASS with BEM class naming, and layout should utilize Flexbox. <br /> <br />

PHASE 2 <br />
the focus has shifted to building an actual API to replace the mock API used previously. The goal is to match the end-points and response structure of the mock API and create a new repository for the server-side code. The API server must have specific end-points for getting videos, getting video details by ID, and posting new videos, with data persistence in a JSON file. Additionally, the video upload functionality is to be implemented, posting videos to the API and persisting them with hardcoded image paths. Visual design must align closely with mockups, addressing any inconsistencies from previous sprints and incorporating feedback. Implementation should adhere to folder structures, utilize provided assets, employ React components with react-router-dom, use SASS variables, apply BEM principles for CSS naming, and use Flexbox for layout. Diving deeper challenges are optional, including implementing comments endpoints, custom video player features, uploading custom poster images, and implementing video liking functionality using PUT endpoints. This sprint aims to deliver the completed product as requested by the client. <br /> <br />

PHASE 3 <br />

The final phase of the BrainFlix project involves the development of a real API to replace the mock API, with specific requirements such as matching API endpoints and responses, implementing video upload functionality, and ensuring data persistence. Additionally, the project must adhere to visual design and implementation requirements, including responsiveness, alignment with mockups, and the incorporation of feedback. It's essential to follow proper folder structures and naming conventions, utilize provided assets, create multiple React components, implement routing, use SASS variables, apply BEM principles for CSS naming, and use Flexbox for layout control. This sprint aims to deliver a complete and polished product as requested by the client. <br /> <br /> <br />
